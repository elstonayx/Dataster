Project Title: Optimization of Landslide Rescue Efforts in Nepal with Satellite Data

Description: A website, Dataster, that integrates satellite data and population demographic in Nepal to  provide real-time facts and figures for rescue teams to deploy manpower to areas most affected by landslides effectively. 

Project Overview:
Since the 1950s, landslides in Nepal has killed over 1,300 people and destroyed 10,000 houses. Nepal, being one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world have inadequate resources and measures for landslide rescue efforts. This makes it difficult to reach out to the vulnerable population that are most at risk in the event of a landslide. 

In response to the current constraints and gaps in landslides rescue efforts in Nepal, our team came up with Dataster. In addition, locals in Nepal are able to contribute and crowdsource information on the whereabouts of their loved ones.
